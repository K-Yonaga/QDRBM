# QDRBM

Quantum Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (QDRBM) is a statistical learning model for pattern recognition. QDRBM has three-layer architecture including a input, hidden, and output layer. In addition, we employ transvers field Ising model in the hidden layer of QDRBM. 

The detail algorithm is presented in the below article.
